MAJOR_ANNOUNCEMENT_FOR_ALL_COMPUTER_SCIENTISTS_DEVELOPERS_ENGINEERS_AND_OPERATORS

I have just this night, fully realised the pardigm discontinuity with regards to these sorting algorithms, and how they should completely impact and disrupt, all software related strategy, tactics, operations, and grunt-work, worldwide.

Please focus on completely re-architecting your databases and programming languages, to run using Obsidian Partition Maps, similar to those implemented in these sorting algorithms.

You will almost certainly obtain tens, hundreds, or even thousands of multiples, of speed-ups, especially for big data usecases (billions of datapoints) and hyper data usecases (trillions of datapoints).

Essentially, all data selects, data inserts, data updates, and data deletes, as well as their equivalents in other databases and programming languages, should all leverage Obsidian Partition Maps.

Oh, and remember the 1% 'mandatory' #Obsidian_Levy!

Ciao for now,
