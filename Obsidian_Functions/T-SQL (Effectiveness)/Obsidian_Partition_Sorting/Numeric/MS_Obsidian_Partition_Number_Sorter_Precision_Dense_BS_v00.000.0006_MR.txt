--COMMENTS:
--This algorithm will provide the best performance with input datasets that have a large range in numerical values (i.e. covering many different significant figures), and also when the digit length distribution of Arguments across this input data range, is as flat/equal/balanced as possible across said significant figure classes.
--For best performance (and this is necessary to take any advantage of the pratitioned sort technique), please remove all leading zeros from each Argument value integer component (this is now done for you in the algorithm), before feeding a dataset into this stored procedure!!!
--In an alternative implementation, you would partition the data into separate partition tables, rather than simply labelling each row with a group label, and indeed, this alternative approach may be even quicker and more energy-efficient, because you would avoid the extra partition group checks, when building the final sorted table.
--The reason why this algorithm is so powerful, is because it takes advantage of the ordinal nature of numbers, such that partitions of the input data are created based on number digit length (significant figures), and thereby massively reduces the exponential sorting penalty where usually every pair of Arguments would have to be checked for order. Instead, because we now have significant figure or number digit length paritions, we only experience a very shallow exponentiation penalty, because we only have to check pairs of number Arguments within a partition, and then we simply append the ordered partitions into a fully-ordered superset. You should experience maybe more than multiples of compute speed and energy efficiency performance improvements on truly big data problem spaces (Billions of Argument values), and especially on hyper data problem spaces (Trillions of Argument values), that need to be sorted.
--Essentially, the algorithm works so effectively in speeding up ordering compute time, by doing a sizeable amount of linear pre-transformations and pre-partitions (TRUST THE SEEMING MADNESS... IT WILL SERIOUSLY REDUCE COMPUTATION EXPONENTIATION WITH BIG AND HYPER DATA VOLUMES), in order to eliminate most of the painfully exponential Argument-pair-wise ordering computations (which would otherwise become prohibitive in big and hyper data volumes)... We implement separate partitions for digits in the integer component but not the decimal component (because the decimal component would require us to resolve integer component splits, which would necessarily require at least one cross join, which would therefore make the algorithm always slower than a native SQL single ordering cross join)... In this way, maximal number sorting speed can be achieved...

--NOTA BENE 0001: I understand that Min() and Max() require a basic ordering algorithm which is 'slow' (and would otherwise lead to a longer compute time due to the fact there are multiple calls to the functions Min() and Max() in this algorithm), but, because we have massively group partitioned data whenever we use these functions against a result set, the exponential detriment of the basic ordering algorithm is absolutely minimised... You should still find that overall, this algorithm is significantly speedier than the native SQL Server 'Order By' clause on its own, when applied directly to a table of input numbers!!!...
--NOTA BENE 0002: I have now implemented here, an enriched partition sort algorithm, that allows you to partition based on Argument decimal compoenents as well, by adding a resolution global variable... This particular algorithm should be used instead of the standard vanilla partition sorter, if your dataset usecase makes dense use of the decimal place digits across all the input dataset Arguments... But please remember, that you will still have to optimise this resolution variable at test time, using representative data distributions and counts...

--LOAD TESTING: I can't really test this properly on my SQL_Express setup, so can someone else please investigate thoroughly, and release some vividly illuminating statistics, which demonstrate the clear superirority of this algorithm, in most big and hyper data number sorting usecases... I actually expect this algorithm to be superior to the native SQL Server equivalent, once data volumes exceed around 10 million Arguments that need to be sorted (possibly even less than this will experience significant speed improvements)...

--FINAL COMMENTS ABOUT USAGE: I reasonably theorise, that if you plan to sort on multiple columns, the speed improvements will get exponentially superior by using this algorithm, in proportion to the number of columns that use it in order to sort...
