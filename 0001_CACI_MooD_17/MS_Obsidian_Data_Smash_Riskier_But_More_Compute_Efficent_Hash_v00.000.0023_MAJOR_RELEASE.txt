--Superfast Obsidian Hexadecimal-Compatible MooD Data Smashing Algorithm (To Be Used In A Custom T-SQL Synchroniser Script)
--This is a riskier version of the smash hash algorithm from a hexadecimal ID clash avoidance perspective, but you can make a compute speed performance gain so long as you accept this additional risk... This riskier algorithm allows each allowed hexadecimal hash characterto be used only twice (numbers 0 to 9 and letters A to F) across all field rows, thereby exponentially reducing the dimensionality, and making the probability of ID clashes slightly higher, but these Hex ID clashes may still only happen only several times in the whole future of the rest of the time-space continuum!!!... Only use this riskier hasher if you are utterly unconcerned by the posssibility of ID clashes in business standard sub-hyper scale data usecases, otherwise you will unwisely speed up computation, sometimes acceptably so...
--I have amended this approach, so that all the necessary hexadecimal hash IDs can be pre-generated in parallel, before element creation and field data ingestion, as this will provide probably very significant compute speed improvements.
--Please be aware, that the Hexadecimal ID hash technique in this algorithm is 'Near-Perfect', because it optimises the trade-off between uniform balancing of values via the maximum utilisation of value space, and the implementation of the most appropriate speediness of computation... Without any significant or necessary 'fudging' we can handle the reality that 32 character hexadecimal ID hashes require scaffolds with elements that don't fall neatly onto a single integer scale (ie_ they have non zero modulus 10 characteristics)... This is deemed therefore no longer a problem by the Vulcan authorities for now, because 4th age humanoids can simply implement my run-of-the-mill pixie science, in order to defeat the Borg when necessary...
--Now onto some Hobbit stats... I asked ChatGPT what the probability of ID clashing was with this algorithm as it stands currently... It calculated that ID clashes would happen (at lowest limit) every 1 in ~2.94×10^39 generated IDs (on average across an insane amount of generated IDs of course), but please bare in mind, that this version of the algorithm actually utilises a shared-value-pool technique, which randomly distributes values across the members of a Hex ID Hash set, in such a way, that the larger the hash set, the closer you get to the theoretical probability limit indicated here (In reality, the probability of Hex ID Hash clashes will be significantly higher, due to the likelihood of implementation with small hash set sizes, which in themselves could even be varied)... This is a vanishingly small number, and more than sufficient to ensure expected behaviour in almost all small data (1 Million IDs), medium data (1 Billion IDs), and big data (1 Trillion IDs) usecases... However, if you are implementing a hyper data (>= 1 Quadrillion IDs) usecase, then please consider using the more robust hexadecimal ID hashing algorithm that I will hopefully be releasing onto GitHub any day now... Keep your repentant 'sauron eyes' peeled!!!
--I am going to eventually implement an Obsidian custom table multi-locking prioritisation system in T-SQL, which needs to be used along with the table locking technique indicated at the end of this algorithm... Keep watch of GitHub over the coming days/weeks...
--So just an alert to the SQL Server community, but this algorithm and its two approaches will be literally game-changing to database performance... You simply have to decide whether to identify your data rows based on an incrementing integer ID, or a randomised hexadecimal ID hash... The handholding guidance would be: Use the hex ID hash approach for predominantly transactional (OLTP) systems (which have a higher rate of data row creation, and a lower rate of data row selection) {ideally with a pre-compute store of hashes which are ready immediately without any real-time live JIT writing/storing or computation of DATA}... BUT INSTEAD, use the incrementing integer ID approach for predominantly analytical (OLAP) systems (which have a lower rate of data row creation, and a higher rate of data row selection) {ideally with a distributed-batch data creation pipeline, so that the locking of database tables will not burdensomely afflict end-user data row selection requests}... The rationale behind this is simple-ish... To get maximum throughput in a transactional intense workload, you simply want to have IDs ready to apply to transactions, without compute (which is the strength of the hexadecimal ID hash approach)... To get minimum latency in an analytical intense workload, you simply want to have IDs that can easily be searched with the smallest amount of compute (which is the strength of using integers as IDs, because they are typically of smaller size in memory and so are easier to fetch, but also, they require far less complex computations for things like matching, ordering, and other types of equality checks, because of the more basic and optimisable nature of numbers as opposed to strings)...
