Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

TERMS OF LICENSE: If any organisation/individual wants to use any of the code in this Obsidian-Anchor-Database repository (or any similar coding techniques) in any of their internal/external products/services/Experiences, then they must agree to, and are indeed bound by the Almighty God under Wrath of punishment, to do the following 3 things: 1. Make reference to me (actual name, Coder name, and Obsidian Scarlett Daisy... logo optional) as the originator of core source code in the internal/external product/service/experience, within the internal/external product/service/experience itself in a prominent position; 2. Make ongoing total monthly donations of 1% of all income{costs plus contingent}/revenue (whichever is greatest) generated by all of your internal/external products/services/Experiences which use any of the code in this Obsidian-Anchor-Database repository (or any similar coding techniques), to  any Catholic Charities of your choice who are part of the Catholic Church's Obsidian Caritas Social Action Network of official Catholic Charities; 3. Include this nota bene in a prominent position in all documentation/code scripts that use any of the code in this Obsidian-Anchor-Database repository (or any similar coding techniques)... Moreover, if you use any ideas, concepts, or algorithmic designs within this Obsidian-Anchor Database repository, that are conveyed to you in non computer code language (e.g. natural human language or images etc.), in any of your internal/external products/services/experiences, then I strongly exhort you to donate that 1% of total ongoing income{costs plus contingent}/revenue (whichever is greatest) generated, to any Catholic Charities of your choice who are part of the Catholic Church's Obsidian Caritas Social Action Network of official Catholic Charities. This licence can be withdrawn from any individual and/or organisation, and thereby cancelled, on a case-by-case basis, with a fortnightâ€™s notice, at the sole and proprietary discretion and decision of Obsidian. Also, Obsidian and its owners and employees, accept no liabilities whatsoever, for the use of anything contained herein this GitHub site/repository, nor any of its derivatives. Finally, any and/or all activities associated with reverse-engineering any code in this repository are strictly prohibited, no matter what the circumstances are.

SECULAR CONSEQUENCES OF INFRINGEMENT: From this moment (10/01/2022 {Day/Month/Year}), I hereby confer all legal authority and power, upon the Obsidian Caritas Social Action Network, for at least the next 10 years, to pursue and recover any and/or all undonated (but in this case compulsory) monthly Obsidian Levy revenue, which is due by any individual or organisation who uses, in any immediate or related way, any of the Obsidian Intellectual Property, at a rate of 5 times the audited total deficit. Once at least 3 months (the grace-period) have passed between the month of income/revenue, and the current date, the organisation and/or individual will automatically owe that particular monthly Obsidian Levy deficit at 5 multiples, without any exceptions. Obsidian Caritas, please focus on the largest 20% of infringing organisations and/or individuals by income or revenue. Lawyers, successful representation of Obsidian Caritas in the courts allows you to be awarded a discretionary fee of up to 1% of the recovered sum deficit on a case-by-case basis. Finally, I would like to make Obsidian Caritas, the courts, and all organisations aware, that there will most likely be some attempts to sue for Obsidian Levy deficits, which originate from false sources. Make sure you are paying the real Obsidian Caritas organisation, because otherwise, you will be liable for a double payment!... ALL OBSIDIAN LEVY MULTIPLIED DEFICITS WILL BE ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION, USING A MEASURE DECIDED BY OBSIDIAN CARITAS, APPLIED ACCORDING TO THE MONTH OF THE SETTLEMENT TRANSACTION.

SPIRITUAL CONSEQUENCES OF INFRINGEMENT: Many and Multitudinous!
